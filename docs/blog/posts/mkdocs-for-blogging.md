So I previously had a blog where I haphazardly threw together some of my favorite recipes, thoughts on technology, and any other opinions I had. I honestly have no idea why, but I felt really inspired by the technical documentation at [EKS best practices](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/). This website is highly learnable, efficient, and of course my favorite user interface design principle; Usable. So I got the itch to build my own blog again, using the open source documentation library they used; [Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

 I've built this website you're at now, and I have some thoughts about the process. Mainly that I have enoyed this, and am excited to continue this process.
